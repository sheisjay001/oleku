# AI-Powered EdTech Platform for Nigerian Students

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered education technology (EdTech) website designed to serve two major learner groups in Nigeria:

1. University students – understanding any course material by uploading or taking a picture of their study resources.
2. Secondary school students (JAMB UTME candidates) – full preparation using the official JAMB 2026 syllabus and CBT-style practice exams.

The platform emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and strict exam alignment.
