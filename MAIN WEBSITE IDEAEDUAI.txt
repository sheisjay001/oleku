based on what the website is about:An AI powered EdTech website that teaches university students in Nigeria whatever course they are studying, they will just take a picture of their resource material and it will break it down in the simplest way possible for them. I  also want in that same website a full JAMB UTME subjects(using the the latest jamb curriculum) for secondary school students, so they can study. As well as, timed quizzes(60 English questions, and 40 questions each for all other subjects). And it will be 2 hours for the total quiz(that is English and 4 other subjects). English as a mandatory subject by jamb utme that is why it must be in all quizzes and must be of 60 questions, fix this:Oleku JAMB Tutor
